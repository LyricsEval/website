The way things stand now That's the way things used to be It's a long long time ago And that was a long time ago We were friends in high school But there's been a change in the air that we breathe It's such a cold hard cold hard cold hard cold hard Hold me back, hold me back Hold me back, hold me back Hold me back, hold me back
