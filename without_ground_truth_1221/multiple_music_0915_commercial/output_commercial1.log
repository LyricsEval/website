Vanilla Lyrics: 
He was only sixteen-years-old He would never leave the edge of town The streets would always be crowded with kids But he always walked around in a hurry But he felt so high and free And he'd never leave the edge of town To find me in a tightrope In a tightrope, he could make his way back home In a tightrope, he could make his way back home

Vanilla Lyrics: 
My heart beats faster With every minute of a lifetime You'll never reach out, you won't reach out to me And the clouds are clearing, they're breaking my fall With the winds of love We'll sail over the water As the river waters pour Let's make tomorrow so bright And this world is changing so fast My life moves so slow My mind's still reeling, I'm still reeling
